# NFL-Head-Coach-Analysis
This project goes over the past 20 years of NFL head coaching data, in a effort to see if the NFL has bee neglible in its hiring of minority coaches. Originally, this was only a class project but I really enjoyed the outcome of this project and wanted to continue looking into it. 

# The Data
The data was made in combination from season by season head coaching records provided by Pro Football Reference and The Institute For Diversity & Ethics In Sport. Each season from 2025-2005 the head coaching record was added to a large spreadsheet that also makred their minoirty status. Finally interim coaches were kept on as some head coaches were retained after taking over as an interim. 

# Outcomes
Minority and White coaches length of tenure, rehiring rate for coaches who had previously held a head coaching position where all deemed to be not be signifcantly different than each other however winning percentage and hirning rates were deemed to signficantly different. White coaches won 6% more compared to minority coaches, and hiried disproportionately hire than minority coaches. Even with the Rooney rules implementation minority coaches were disproportionately hired compared to white coaches.
